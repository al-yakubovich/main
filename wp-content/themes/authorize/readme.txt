== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Authorize includes support for Jetpack's Featured Posts.

= How do I set up the home page panels (grey boxes)? =
These panels display the featured image and excerpt from selected pages.

To add them to you site, go to:
Customizer -> Static Front Page.
There you'll see the options:
 -  Home Feature: Left
 -  Home Feature: Right Top
 -  Home Feature: Right Bottom

Select the page you want to highlight in these areas from the drop-down box of pages.
Note:  Only pages can be used.
Save and publish the changes.

= How do I set up Featured Content (gold boxes on home page) =
On any post or page, simply add the tag 'feature'.
This theme will display the 6 most recent pages/posts with a 'feature' tag.
The font page will display the featured image and excerpt of the post/page.

= Where are the sidebars (widget areas) exactly? =
There are 3 basic sidebars in this theme.

Sidebar Front Page:
This is the sidebar (widget area) that appears on the front page of the site only.

Sidebar Inside:
This sidebar (widget area) appears on ALL pages EXCEPT the front page.
Note:  if you want widgets on the front page and all the other pages, add the same widget to both sidebars.

Footers:
There are 3 footer areas -- each a sidebars/widget area. 
They are the same for all pages and posts -- home page and other pages.

= How do I get the icons beside 'Recent Posts' & What's does 'Entry Type' mean on posts?  =
With authorize, you can select what kind of post it is, it's used to improve the look of the 'Recent Posts' widget.  

When a post is displayed, it will try and display the featured image as a thumbnail beside it.  If there is no featured image, it will display the icon based on the 'Entry Type.

Note:  Changing the 'Entry Type' does not affect the Format of the post.  You need to set that separately.
